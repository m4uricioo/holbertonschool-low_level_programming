what are Macros in C language?
The macro in C language is known as the piece of code which can be replaced by the macro value. The macro is defined with the help of #define preprocessor directive and the macro doesnâ€™t end with a semicolon(;). Macro is just a name given to certain values or expressions it doesn't point to any memory location.

Whenever the compiler encounters the macro, it replaces the macro name with the macro value. Two macros could not have the same name.

The syntax of the macro is as shown in the following figure. Here, we will have the three components:

#define - Preprocessor Directive
PI - Macro Name
3.14 - Macro Valu
